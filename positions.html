							<b>Position Summary 8/7/2020:</b></br>
						</br>
							Washington University in St. Louis, MO Dept. of Cell Biology seeks Staff Scientist to assist in developing and conducting research project, including experiment design, data analysis, and documentation of experiment results.
							Specific research project includes the research of protein kinases to define kinase protein-protein interaction networks and substrates, with the goal of illuminating the connectivity of these kinases to various aspects of cell biology.
							The broader goal of the research is to better understand altered signal transduction in human disease and in cancer.  Staff Scientist will teach junior technicians and students wet-bench techniques, experimental design, and data analysis and data visualization.
							The techniques to be performed in the research include: i) molecular cloning of understudied kinases open reading frames; ii) viral-mediated expression of kinases in human cell lines; iii) live cell biotinylation, iv) protein complex affinity and immune purification;
							v) protein digestion and peptide purification; vi) liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry-based protein sequencing of kinase complexes; vii) computational proteomics and network probabilistic scoring, and viii) network validation and mechanistic studies of cell and cancer biology.</br>
							</br>
						<u>Primary Duties and Responsibilities: </u></br>
							1.	Generates data for publication and aid in writing manuscripts and grants.</br>
							2.	Designs and implements research protocols, including developing procedures for the collection, verification, and management of data.</br>
							3.	Performs complex statistical analysis and writes interpretive reports.</br>
							4.	Assists with grant preparation and regular reports to NIH and present research. </br>
							5.	Maintains lab stocks of recombinant plasmids and cell lines and handles practical problems with equipment. </br>
							6.	Procures lab reagents and materials.</br>
							</br>
						<u>Minimum Required Qualifications:</u></br>
							Masterâ€™s degree with 4 years of experience in research lab operations or equivalent combination of education and experience equaling 9 years required.</br>
							</br>
						<u>Preferred Qualifications:</u></br>
							Preference in degree in biochemistry and mass spectrometry experience.
